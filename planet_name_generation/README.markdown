# Overview #

I have built up the following lists to generate a master pool of planet names
that can be used.  The original Stars! had a total of 999 unique planet names,
which gave an artificial limit to a potential universe size, as each planet
must have a unique name.

My intention here is to attempt to extend that limit to allow for universes of
up to 10,000 planets, without losing on quality of planet names.

# Good Quality Planet Naming #

Here are some properties of the original Stars! planet names:

    Min Length: 2 (Io)
    Max Length: 18 (Wammalammadingdong)
    Max "Words" in a Name: 3 (Le Petit Jean, Double Tall Skinny)
    Mix of letters (A-Z, a-z), numbers (0-9), and some punctuation (-, ')
    Some planets have all numbers (007)
    All planets that start with a letter start with a capital letter (A-Z)
    All secondary words that start with letters start with a capital letter
    Non-numeric names are mostly English-centric using the Latin alphabet
    Planets meanings are a mix of:
        First names of people: Alexander
        Last names of people: Lincoln, Washington, Mozart
        Mythical characters: Loki
        Food: Maple Syrup
        Places on Earth: America
        Places not on Earth: Mars, Milky Way, Ursa Major
        Things not on Earth: Red Giant
        Places from fiction: Asgard
        Computer Programs: Sed, Awk
        Elements: Gold, Silver, Neon
        Compounds: H2O, H2SO4
        Pop-culture references: 3M TA3
        Flowers and trees: Forget-Me-Not
        Mathematical and scientific terms: Cosine
        Other: Flutter Valve, Flaming Poodle
    Planet names refrain from overt profanity and obscenity

The lists that I have built up try to embody the spirit of these principles,
with the only major requirements being length and uniqueness.  Since the planet
names are shown in a fixed-sized spaces, a length of under 20 would be
preferable.  Special and non-Latin characters should not be a huge problem if 
the font allows and the users are still able to type the name if they use some
of the find capabilities.
