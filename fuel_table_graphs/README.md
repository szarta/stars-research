# Fuel table graphs #

The data in these graphs for fuel cost and battle movement comes from Posey's
spreadsheet:

    http://wiki.starsautohost.org/files/posey.zip

That was used to fill my technology models with the correct information, which
I retrieve back out and converted the values (to the logarithmic base 2 Y axis)
with the generate_fuel_table_data.py script.

gnuplot was then used to generate the graphs for each engine.
