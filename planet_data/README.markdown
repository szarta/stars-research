# Planet Data #

Each file represents a full scan of planets.

 * No random events (do not want meteors mucking with mineral values or habs)
 * Only 1 player
 * Generate until tech 26 in all fields then build Nubians with full scanners
 * Because it is late in the game, the homeworld will have concentrations 1
 * Planet info is CSV to make it easier to parse later
 * First line will have any relevant info (race habs, game settings)
 * I merge the universe definition (with X,Y coords) with the planet info
 * I manually add in the planet habs to correlate against the planet value
