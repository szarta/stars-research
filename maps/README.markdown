I have sorted numerous Stars! universe maps of various sizes, generated using
my map-generator script.

These are in service of understanding the algorithms for universe map
generation used by the original game - or at the very least the constraints put
on the universes of different sizes/densities.

I intend to adapt this for other larger universes or oddly-shaped universes in
the future.
