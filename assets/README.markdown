I (Brandon Arrendondo) have created each of these xcf files in GIMP.  With the 
exception of the following, which require attribution, I release all xcf files 
to the public domain.

The icons in each are from the following:

 * Engine icon (used in engine\_slot.xcf and each ship template) from:

 * Electronics (lightning) icon (used in electronics\_slot.xcf and each ship
   template) from:
