# stars-research

This is a collection of any research or reverse engineering done to the
original Stars! game for purposes of building the Stars-Reborn clone.

It focuses mostly on mechanics, data tables, or equations needed to replicate
the original functionality (or come close enough).

I give credit for any of the information here that is from a source that is not 
me - and I discover from the original game otherwise the information, so I
apologize if I am rediscovering information that was otherwise known and
obvious elsewhere.
